Problem Statement:There are a lot of websites , apps which helps us in finding real time weather aqi, but very less when it comes for real life importance. Eg. Not everyone knows that aqi above 250 is considered harmful for human beings , due to which even when some knows about the AQI level many are unaware that whether they should wear mask , or stay in home . This assistant helps those people. Also many weather based websites have very long loading times due to ads and trackers. Most of the weather apps and websites just gives raw numbers without actionable advice(eg. “Should I go outside today with umbrella or without umbrella” or “Should I was my clothes today”).The goal is to build an terminal application that takes your city name and instantly gives rain probability , temperature condition and many more
